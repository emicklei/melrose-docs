A complete `melrose` installation requires:

- Installation of Microsoft Visual Studio Code
- Installation of the extension `melrose-for-vscode`
- Installation of the `melrose` console application

You can either install the application from source or use the unsigned downloadable packages.

## Install Melrōse plugin for the free Visual Studio Code editor

You can install the extension directly from your running Visual Studio Code Editor or by going to the [Marketplace published package](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EMicklei.melrose-for-vscode)

## Install Melrōse from source

Instructions to get the source, install the runtime dependencies and compile the program, is documented in the [README](https://github.com/emicklei/melrose) of the project.

## Install Melrōse from package

Due to increased restrictions and costs of releasing non-commercial packages for the Apple Mac OSX and Microsoft Windows plaform, I can only provide unsigned packages for Apple Mac OSX. 
Contact me (see github) if you want a commercial, signed and supported version.
