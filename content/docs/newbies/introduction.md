### Digital Audio Workstation (DAW)

Melrōse itself does not produce any sound.
Instead, it sends MIDI messages to connected hardware or software, such as a DAW.
There are many open-source and commercial products that provide synthesized sounds for many software instruments.

We have tested `melrose` with only a few such products:

- [Using Melrōse with Garageband](https://xn--melrse-egb.org/blog/daw-apple-garageband/)
    - no support for multi-channel tracks
- [Logic Pro X (commercial)](https://xn--melrse-egb.org/blog/daw-apple-logic-pro-x/)
    - with support for multi-channel tracks
- FL Studio
- LMMS
