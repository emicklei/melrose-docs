Using the `notemap` function with dots `.` and bangs `!` you can write a pattern for an instrument.
In this example, multiple instruments are choosen from the General MIDI set. 
The note `C2` is typically assigned to a Kick drum.
The loop plays the 16 beats in a bar and for each bang `!` it will shortly (16th) play the note.
You can start and stop each loop individually.


Once you have a MIDI capable sound program (such as a DAW) opened then tryout this example with the online [Melr≈çse Playground](https://t.co/yxcJ57PIb3?amp=1) yourself.
